BioXARZ-2 is an adventure and survival video game developed by [Gabriel Torrence](https://github.com/GabrielTorrence8a) and [Guillermo Brito](https://github.com/Alxira5) in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). BioXARZ-2 is set in a post-apocalyptic world, where a strange disaster occurred in the XA Labs, causing a large number of humans and animals to go crazy from the radiation.

In our development center you can find the code that drives [BioXARZ-2](https://github.com/bioxarz-2/bioxarz-2) and other secondary projects.
